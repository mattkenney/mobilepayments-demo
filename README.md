This repo contains an iOS client to demonstrate Apple Pay along with a simple merchant Python/Flask server to help process the payment.

The Apple Pay payment request flows from the iOS client and then, if successful, an Apple Pay token is transmitted to the demo merchant server, which records the payment request and executes the Beanstream Payments API.

In your production flow, the mobile client might transmit other info such as the customer identifier, detailed sales/inventory data, and related shipping and billing addresses. This info might be recorded on a merchants CRM (as an example), and then a request to process the payment using the Apple Pay token would then be made to the Beanstream Payments API. Upon success or failure to process the payment, the merchant’s CRM could be updated and the originating mobile client would then receive a response.
 
This repo's demo client and server are intended to be simple examples to help you with your production implementation.

# Client

The iOS client project was built with XCode 8 and requires Swift 3.0.

# Server

The server project requires Python 3. To build & run the server for local dev you can use a SQLite DB and try the server out by just setting your Beanstream API Passcode as a server side environment variable and then start up as follows.

When the client makes a payment request, it first gets an Apple Pay payment token using standard Apple SDK APIs. It then communicates this info to the Demo Server which is responsible for interacting with the Beanstream Payments API. The Beansteam Payments API has been updated to allow for Apple Pay transactions and the following is a sample POST parameter to use with a RESTful invocation of the Payments API.

```
payload = {
    'amount': float(<purchase_amount>),
    'payment_method': 'apple_pay',
    'apple_pay': {
        'apple_pay_merchant_id': <your_apple_pay_merchant_id>,
        'payment_token': <apple_pay_base64_encoded_token>,
        'complete': <true (Defaults to true if omitted. Used for a purchase) | false (Used for a Pre-Auth.)>
    }
}
```

## Server Setup & Installation

* Execute a git clone command on this repo and in a terminal cd into the root project directory.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/beanstream/mobilepay-demo.git
$ cd mobilepay-demo/server/app
```

* Install virtualenv (if not already available)
```bash
$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv
```

* Create (if not already create) and/or Activate project environment
```bash
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install/update project dependencies
```bash
(venv) app$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution

* To run the flask app just for development only (not for production) just do this:
```bash
(venv) app$ export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/mobilepay-demo.db  # Defaults to this and can be ommitted
(venv) app$ export BIC_API_PASSCODE=<your_beanstream_passcode>
(venv) app$ export BIC_MERCHANT_ID=<your_beanstream_merchant_id>
(venv) app$ python server.py
```

Or if on Windows follow the same as above except set your environment variables via PowerShell as follows.
```
(venv) app$ $env:BIC_API_PASSCODE = "<your_beanstream_passcode>"
(venv) app$ $env:BIC_MERCHANT_ID = "<your_beanstream_merchant_id>"
(venv) app$ $env:DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:////users/<your_user>/appdata/local/temp/mobilepay-demo.db"
```
